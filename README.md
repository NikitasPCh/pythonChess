# pythonChess
A chess app in Python.

Notes:

A. It does not handle victory condition the real way a chess game does. That means that if your king is in check your next move does not have to be on that
   gets him out of it. Nevertheless there *is* a flashing indicator for when your king is in check to make things easier.

For the future:

1. Change how a check is handled.
2. Add special moves (En passant, castling and pawn promotion)
3. Add a timer
